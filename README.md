## PHILOSOPHERS
### I never thought philosophy would be so deadly

My Solution for the philosophers problem as part of the core curriculum from 42Berlin.

**Summary:**<br>
In this project, i learned the basics of threading a process.
I learned how to create threads and I discovered how mutexes work.

**The program takes the following arguments:**<br>
number_of_philosophers<br>
time_to_die<br>
time_to_eat<br>
time_to_sleep<br>
number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat (optional)<br>
<br>
To build the executable use make.<br>
It will create an executable named philo.<br>
<br>
**Example input:**<br>
./a.out 7 400 100 100 (without number of meals)<br>
./aout 7 400 100 100 5 (with number of meals)
